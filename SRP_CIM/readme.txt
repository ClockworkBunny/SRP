Some codes and data for our paper: Semi-Random Projection for Dimensionality Reduction and Extreme Learning Machine in High-Dimensional Space.

1 PCELM: our proposed partically-connected ELM method based on SRP

2 sLDA: Linear Discriminant Analysis, which is used to learn weights for subspace.

3 test_ELM: main code for testing

4 20news_SRP: 20 news data. The index indiciates the row number of the corresponding dataset in Table 2 in our paper. For example, 1 means comp vs rec.
